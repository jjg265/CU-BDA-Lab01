  Hello Professor Loredo. My name is John Gatta, a junior majoring in Biometry and Statistics (offered through the College of Agriculture and Life Science). My interests are vast -- I absolutely love numbers and their power. Specifically, I love analyzing sports statistics data. This new era of "Moneyball" has completely changed the sports industry. General managers and coaches alike are looking for bright young minds that can quantify many aspects of sports that have been solely speculatve for years. By this, I mean we can put a value on an athlete based on their indiviudal contribution to the team. We can do things like: estimate how many wins a player contributes in a season, estimate how many 'expected' points a player contributed during a season, and further, help determine betting lines based on past performance. These statistics are my passion and are certainly something I'd love to be working with in the future. From my knowledge and research, I've learned that Bayesian Statistics are extremely vital to the "sports modeling" industry. Using priors to predict the future cannot be done by frequentist means -- bayesian statistics are the better method of prediction and that is my primary reason for enrolling in this course. I'm eager to learn these methods. I'm eager to learn how to apply these techniques to real sports data, and eventually be able to create my own, unique models. That is the goal, and that is my dream. Being able to regress data to set lines, accurately evaluate players, and even finding the true worth (in $) of a player would be essentials tools for any organization to have, and that is truly what I hope to get out of this course. With your help and the cirriculum, if I work hard I feel this is a realistic goal. Here is an example of some data that I would like to regress on, using advanced metrics to determine a predicted score for any given NFL matchup (including weather, injuries, QB changes, etc.).
